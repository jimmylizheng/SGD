# SGD: Scalable Gaussian Delivery for 3D Scene Transmission

This is the git repo for the implementation of the CSE589 course project: SGD: Scalable Gaussian Delivery for 3D Scene Transmission. The implementation is based on the previous [3D Gaussian Splatting Web Viewer](https://github.com/kishimisu/Gaussian-Splatting-WebGL). Javascript and WebGL2 are used for the implementation of a 3D gaussian rasterizer based on the paper [3D Gaussian Splatting
for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/).

## Quick Start
Clone the project to your local machine.

Run the command "python3 app.py" in your CLI to launch the server.

Run the command "python3 -m http.server 8000" in your CLI to launch the client.

Access the client rendering result through "http://localhost:8000/"

## Background

I wanted to get a better understanding on how 3D gaussians splats are used in rasterization pipelines to achieve real time results, so I tried to reimplement the rendering algorithm in a framework I'm familiar with (WebGL).
The next step if I find the time will be to make a WebGPU version too in order to compare the performances.

## Implementation Details

In this implementation, each gaussian is processed by a vertex shader to create a screen-space bounding rectangle made of 4 vertices, which is then colorized using a fragment shader.

#### Scale, Rotation, 3D covariance

In the original implementation, the scale and rotation attributes for each gaussian are sent to the GPU in order to calculate its 3D covariance matrix, which is ultimately used to compute its screen-space bouding rectangle. This allow to dynamically resize the splats for visualization purposes.

In this implementation, the 3D covariance is pre-computed as a one-time operation to avoid recomputing it at each frame, and also avoid sending the scale and rotation attributes to the GPU.
The splat size parameter is used differently to still allow to dynamically resize the splats 

#### Harmonics

The gaussians don't have a "color" attribute, instead their color is encoded using 16 spherical harmonics (that are vectors of 3 components). This allow for a more realistic view-dependant lighting, however it needs 48 floats per gaussian which is huge for scenes that typically have millions of gaussians.
Fortunately, not all of the harmonics coefficients are necessary to compute the final color, using more will only increase the accuracy. Here are the different degrees we can use:

- Degree 3: 16 harmonics (48 floats) per gaussian
- Degree 2: 9 harmonics (27 floats) per gaussian
- Degree 1: 4 harmonics (12 floats) per gaussian
- Degree 0: 1 harmonic (3 floats) per gaussian [no view-dependant lighting]

All degrees above 0 are view-dependant and the color for each gaussian needs to be recomputed each time the view matrix is updated.
Using degree 0 for this implementation is clearly the best in term of performances as it avoid sending any spherical harmonic to the GPU, and allow to pre-compute the gaussian color as a one-time operation before rendering.
The visual impact is clearly negligible compared to the performance gain.

#### Sorting
